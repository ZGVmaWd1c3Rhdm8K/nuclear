Fizzy Difussion: The process of fizzy difussion use one série of porous membrans or barriers to separate the urânium-235 of urânium-238 with basis in the differences of yours difussions taxes in one inert gas, with the hélio.
                 This process have one higher cost and consum one big energy.

Ultracentrifugation: This process, The urânium is converted in one gás highest volátile, after is putted in one centrífugation that spin one higher speed.
                     This make as that the uranium-238, not build up inside of centrífugation, with the urânium-235 concentrating more closer of middle in the position that is collected

eletromagnétic separation: This method, the urânium is converted in íons then is accelerated throught of one eletric camp and magnétic.
                           This make as that the uranium-238 are deviated more than the urânium-235, permiting that hes be separateds.

Laser of Isotopes Excitement: Is one process that cover the use of lasers to ionize the átoms of urânium-235 and separate of urânium-238 atoms.
