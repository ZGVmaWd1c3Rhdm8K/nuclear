Obtaining the uranium: The first step is obtain the uranium, that can be encountered in mines or extracted from uranium deposits in all worldwide.
                       The uranium is encountered in the nature and generally is constitued for one mix of urânium-238 and urânium-235.

Conversion of hexafluoreto of urânium (UF6): The urânium is converted in UF6, that is one chemical compost volátile, used in processes of enrichment of urânium.

Enrichment of uranium: The gás UF6 is putted in one centrifugue, that spin in higher speed.
                       The centrifugation is the gas power UF6 the if separate in your differences of isotopies, as the urânium-238 if concentrating in bord of centrífugue and the urânium-235 more closer of center.
                       This process is repeated inumerous times, increased the enrichemnent of urânium each iteration.

Separation: After inumerous iterations, the UF6 enrichement in urânium-235 is separated of UF6 commum and is collected to be used in specific applications, as in nuclear reactors or in nuclear weapons.
